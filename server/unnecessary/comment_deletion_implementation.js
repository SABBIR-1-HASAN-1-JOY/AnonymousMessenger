/* 
 * COMMENT DELETION IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 * ====================================
 * 
 * Current Implementation:
 * - The comment deletion functionality has been enhanced to support admin mode
 * - Admin users can delete any comment when in admin mode (x-admin-mode header = true)
 * - Regular users can only delete their own comments
 * - The system currently uses manual cascading deletion in the controller
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * 1. client/src/components/common/CommentComponent.tsx
 *    - Added admin delete buttons with distinct styling
 *    - Added x-admin-mode header for admin deletions
 *    - Disabled edit buttons in admin mode (admin can only delete, not edit)
 * 
 * 2. server/controllers/commentControllers.js
 *    - Enhanced deleteComment function to support admin mode
 *    - Added admin mode detection via x-admin-mode header
 *    - Modified ownership check to allow admin deletions
 *    - Manual cascading deletion of child comments
 * 
 * Database Trigger Alternative:
 * - comment_cascade_delete_trigger.sql contains a PostgreSQL trigger
 * - This trigger would automatically handle cascading deletes at the database level
 * - If implemented, the manual cascading code in the controller could be removed
 * - The trigger is more efficient and ensures data integrity
 * 
 * How to Test:
 * 1. Navigate to any post/review with comments while in admin mode (?admin=true)
 * 2. Look for "Admin Delete" buttons next to comments
 * 3. Admin can delete any comment, regular users only their own
 * 4. Deleting a parent comment will delete all its replies
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - Admin mode is only accessible with proper authentication
 * - x-admin-mode header is required for admin deletions
 * - Different confirmation messages for admin vs owner deletions
 * - Clear visual indicators for admin actions

// Example Admin Delete Request:
// DELETE /api/comments/123
// Headers:
//   Authorization: Bearer <token>
//   user-id: <admin_user_id>
//   x-admin-mode: true

// The system will:
// 1. Verify the user is authenticated
// 2. Check if admin mode is enabled
// 3. Allow deletion regardless of comment ownership
// 4. Delete the comment and all its replies
// 5. Return success with admin deletion flag

  // This file is for documentation purposes
  // The actual implementation is in the controller and component files
