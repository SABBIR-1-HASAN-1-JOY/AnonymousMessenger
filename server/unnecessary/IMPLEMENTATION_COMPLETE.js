/* 
 * COMMENT DELETION WITH ADMIN MODE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
 * ========================================================
 * 
 * ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:
 * 
 * 1. Frontend Implementation (CommentComponent.tsx):
 *    - Admin delete buttons with distinct red styling
 *    - "Admin Delete" vs "Delete" button labels
 *    - Admin mode header (x-admin-mode: true) sent to backend
 *    - Edit buttons disabled in admin mode (admin can only delete)
 *    - Different confirmation messages for admin vs owner deletions
 * 
 * 2. Backend Implementation (commentControllers.js):
 *    - Enhanced deleteComment function with admin mode support
 *    - Admin mode detection via x-admin-mode header
 *    - Modified ownership check: users can delete own comments OR admin can delete any
 *    - Manual cascading deletion of all child/descendant comments
 *    - Different success messages indicating admin vs user deletion
 * 
 * 3. Integration with Admin System:
 *    - PostDetail.tsx: ✅ Already passes isAdminMode to CommentComponent
 *    - ReviewDetail.tsx: ✅ Already passes isAdminMode to CommentComponent  
 *    - RateMyWorkDetail.tsx: ✅ Already passes isAdminMode to CommentComponent
 *    - All detail pages work with admin mode via ?admin=true parameter
 * 
 * 4. Database Trigger Option:
 *    - Created comment_cascade_delete_trigger.sql for automatic cascading
 *    - PostgreSQL trigger function for recursive comment deletion
 *    - Can replace manual cascading if preferred
 * 
 * HOW TO USE:
 * 1. Navigate to any content page with ?admin=true parameter
 * 2. Look for red "Admin Delete" buttons next to all comments
 * 3. Admin can delete any comment regardless of ownership
 * 4. Deleting a parent comment automatically deletes all replies
 * 5. Clear confirmation dialogs distinguish admin vs owner actions
 * 
 * SECURITY FEATURES:
 * - Requires proper authentication and admin context
 * - x-admin-mode header validation on backend
 * - Visual indicators for admin actions
 * - Separate permission logic for admin vs regular users
 * 
 * CASCADING DELETE BEHAVIOR:
 * - Manual implementation in controller ensures all child comments are deleted
 * - Recursive deletion handles nested comment hierarchies
 * - Returns count of total deleted comments (parent + all descendants)
 * - Database trigger option available for automatic handling
 * 
 * TESTING SCENARIOS:
 * 1. Regular user can only delete their own comments
 * 2. Admin user can delete any comment when in admin mode
 * 3. Deleting parent comment removes all child comments
 * 4. Multi-level nested comments are properly handled
 * 5. Proper error handling for non-existent comments
 * 
 * The implementation is complete and ready for use!
