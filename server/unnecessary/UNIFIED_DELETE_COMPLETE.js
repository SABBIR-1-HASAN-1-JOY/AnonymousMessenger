/* 
 * UNIFIED DELETE FUNCTIONALITY - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
 * ======================================================
 * 
 * ✅ CHANGES MADE:
 * 
 * 1. CommentComponent.tsx:
 *    - Removed separate "Admin Delete" styling and text
 *    - Unified delete button appears for both owners and admins
 *    - Single confirmation message for all users
 *    - Maintains admin mode header transmission (x-admin-mode: true)
 * 
 * 2. PostDetail.tsx:
 *    - Unified delete button logic: shows for owners OR admins
 *    - Edit button only shows for owners (not admins)
 *    - Added x-admin-mode header to delete requests
 *    - Single delete button styling for both user types
 * 
 * 3. ReviewDetail.tsx:
 *    - Unified delete button logic: shows for owners OR admins
 *    - Edit button only shows for owners (not admins)
 *    - Added x-admin-mode header to delete requests
 *    - Single delete button styling for both user types
 * 
 * 4. RateMyWorkDetail.tsx:
 *    - Unified delete button logic: shows for owners OR admins
 *    - Edit button only shows for owners (not admins)
 *    - Added x-admin-mode header to delete requests
 *    - Single delete button styling for both user types
 * 
 * 5. Backend Controllers:
 *    - commentControllers.js: ✅ Already had admin mode support
 *    - postControllers.js: ✅ Added admin mode support (x-admin-mode header detection)
 *    - reviewControllers.js: ✅ Added admin mode support (x-admin-mode header detection)
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS NOW:
 * 
 * For Regular Users:
 * - See delete button only on their own content
 * - x-admin-mode header is NOT sent
 * - Backend checks ownership before allowing deletion
 * 
 * For Admin Users (when ?admin=true):
 * - See delete button on ALL content (their own + others)
 * - x-admin-mode: true header is sent automatically
 * - Backend allows deletion regardless of ownership when admin mode detected
 * - Edit buttons are hidden (admins can only delete, not edit others' content)
 * 
 * SECURITY FEATURES:
 * - Admin mode only works when user has isAdmin: true in AuthContext
 * - Admin mode only activates with ?admin=true URL parameter
 * - Backend validates x-admin-mode header for permission bypass
 * - All delete operations include proper logging for audit trail
 * 
 * USER EXPERIENCE:
 * - No visual distinction between owner and admin delete buttons
 * - Same confirmation dialogs for all users
 * - Same delete button styling and behavior
 * - Clear separation: owners can edit+delete, admins can only delete
 * 
 * TESTING SCENARIOS:
 * 1. Regular user: can only delete their own content
 * 2. Admin user (normal mode): can only delete their own content
 * 3. Admin user (?admin=true): can delete any content
 * 4. Edit buttons: only visible to content owners, never to admins in admin mode
 * 5. Backend: properly validates admin mode headers and ownership
 * 
 * The implementation provides a clean, unified delete experience while maintaining
 * proper security and permission controls.
