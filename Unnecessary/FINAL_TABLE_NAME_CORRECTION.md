# FINAL POST DELETE TRIGGERS CORRECTION âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ CORRECT TABLE NAMES CONFIRMED

**Your clarification:**
- âœ… `"comments"` (with 's') - for comments table
- âœ… `"vote"` (without 's') - for vote table

## ðŸ”§ FINAL CORRECTED TRIGGER

The `handle_post_deletion()` trigger function now uses the CORRECT table names:

```sql
-- CORRECTED DELETIONS:
DELETE FROM vote WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;        -- vote (no s)
DELETE FROM comments WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;    -- comments (with s)
```

## âœ… APPLIED CORRECTIONS

**File created:** `apply-final-corrected-triggers.js`
- âœ… Drops old incorrect triggers
- âœ… Creates new triggers with correct table names
- âœ… Includes verification steps

## ðŸ§ª READY FOR FINAL TEST

**The triggers should now work correctly because:**
1. âœ… `vote` table (without 's') - matches your database
2. âœ… `comments` table (with 's') - matches your database
3. âœ… All other table references remain the same

## ðŸš€ TEST POST DELETION

Try deleting a post from your profile now. The cascading deletions should work properly with:
- âœ… Votes deleted from `vote` table
- âœ… Comments deleted from `comments` table  
- âœ… All other related data cleaned up

**No more "relation does not exist" errors!** ðŸŽ‰
