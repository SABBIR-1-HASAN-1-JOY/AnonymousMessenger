-- STEP 3: CREATE THE TRIGGER
-- ================================================================

-- STEP 4: VERIFY THE TRIGGER WAS CREATED
-- ================================================================

    tgrelid::regclass AS table_name, 
    tgfoid::regproc AS function_name,
    tgenabled AS enabled
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_handle_post_deletion';

-- ================================================================
-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
-- ================================================================
SELECT 'Post deletion triggers have been successfully applied! 
The triggers now correctly handle all related data with proper column mappings:

âœ… FIXED ISSUES:
â€¢ votes table: Now uses entity_id (was incorrectly using post_id)
â€¢ comments table: Now uses entity_id (was incorrectly using post_id)

âœ… WORKING CORRECTLY:
â€¢ post_ratings table: Uses post_id
â€¢ notifications table: Uses entity_id  
â€¢ photos table: Uses source_id
â€¢ reports table: Uses reported_item_id

ðŸ§ª TEST THE SYSTEM:
1. Create a post in your app
2. Add some comments and votes to it
3. Delete the post from your profile
4. Check that comments and votes are also deleted

The cascading deletion will now work properly!' AS status;
