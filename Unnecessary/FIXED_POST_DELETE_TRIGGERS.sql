-- FIXED POST DELETE TRIGGERS SETUP
-- Updated to handle entity_id foreign keys in votes and comments tables

-- STEP 1: Drop and recreate the corrected deletion function

-- ==================================================
-- TEST THE CORRECTED SETUP
-- ==================================================

-- Test the cascading deletion with correct column mappings
SELECT test_post_deletion_cascade();

-- Clean up any orphaned data
SELECT cleanup_orphaned_post_data();

-- ==================================================
-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ==================================================

-- Check table structures to verify column names
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns

-- ==================================================
-- SUMMARY
-- ==================================================
/*
FIXED ISSUES:
✅ Updated votes deletion to use entity_id instead of post_id
✅ Updated comments deletion to use entity_id instead of post_id  
✅ Added more detailed test function with separate counters
✅ Enhanced logging to show which deletions were performed
✅ Updated cleanup function with correct column names

The trigger now correctly handles:
• post_ratings table: Uses post_id column ✅
• comments table: Uses entity_id column ✅  
• votes table: Uses entity_id column ✅
• notifications table: Uses entity_id column ✅
• photos table: Uses source_id column ✅
• reports table: Uses reported_item_id column ✅
