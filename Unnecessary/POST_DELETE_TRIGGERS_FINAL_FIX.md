# POST DELETE TRIGGERS - FINAL FIX

## üîç PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The post deletion triggers were not working because the `votes` and `comments` tables use **`entity_id`** as the foreign key column, but our triggers were incorrectly using **`post_id`**.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION
The corrected triggers now use the proper column mappings:

| Table | Foreign Key Column | Status |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| `post_ratings` | `post_id` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `votes` | `entity_id` | ‚úÖ **FIXED** |
| `comments` | `entity_id` | ‚úÖ **FIXED** |
| `notifications` | `entity_id` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `photos` | `source_id` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `reports` | `reported_item_id` | ‚úÖ Working |

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE FIX OPTIONS

### Option 1: Execute SQL Commands Directly (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open your database client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, or any PostgreSQL client)
2. Connect to your Neon database: 
   ```
   postgresql://demo_owner:npg_FXUnhG86jcYw@ep-silent-heart-a85851wo-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/demo
   ```
3. Copy and paste the SQL commands from `EXECUTE_THESE_TRIGGERS.sql`
4. Run them one by one or all at once

### Option 2: Use Node.js Script
Run this command in your server directory:
```bash
cd "d:\CSE Database Project\Last hope\server"
node direct-trigger-fix.js
```

### Option 3: Manual Commands
Execute these SQL commands directly in your database:

```sql
-- Drop existing
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS "public"."handle_post_deletion"() CASCADE;

-- Create corrected function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."handle_post_deletion"()
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Post deletion triggered for post_id: %', OLD.post_id;
    
    DELETE FROM notifications WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
    DELETE FROM photos WHERE type = 'post' AND source_id = OLD.post_id;
    DELETE FROM reports WHERE reported_item_type = 'post' AND reported_item_id = OLD.post_id;
    DELETE FROM votes WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
    DELETE FROM comments WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
    
    RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE COST 100;

-- Create trigger
CREATE TRIGGER "trigger_handle_post_deletion"
    AFTER DELETE ON "public"."post"
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION "public"."handle_post_deletion"();
```

## üß™ TESTING
After applying the triggers:

1. **Create a test post** in your app
2. **Add comments and votes** to that post
3. **Delete the post** from your profile
4. **Verify** that comments and votes are also deleted

## üìã VERIFICATION
Run this to check if the trigger exists:
```sql
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass, tgfoid::regproc 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'trigger_handle_post_deletion';
```

## üéØ KEY CHANGES MADE
- **Fixed `votes` table**: Changed from `post_id` to `entity_id`
- **Fixed `comments` table**: Changed from `post_id` to `entity_id`
- Added proper logging to see what's being deleted
- Added `ROW_COUNT` to track deletion counts

The triggers should now work correctly for cascading post deletions! üéâ
