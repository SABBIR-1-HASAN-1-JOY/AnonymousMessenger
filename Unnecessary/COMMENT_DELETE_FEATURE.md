# COMMENT DELETION FEATURE ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 FEATURES ADDED

### Backend Implementation
✅ **Enhanced Comment Controller** (`commentControllers.js`):
- Added user authorization (only comment owner can delete)
- Implemented cascading deletion (deletes all replies when parent comment is deleted)
- Added detailed logging and error handling
- Returns count of total deleted items (comment + replies)

### Database Operations
✅ **Cascading Deletion Logic**:
- Deletes all replies first using `parent_comment_id`
- Then deletes the main comment
- No triggers needed - handled via SQL queries
- Provides detailed feedback on deletion results

### Frontend Implementation
✅ **Enhanced CommentComponent** (`CommentComponent.tsx`):
- Added delete button with trash icon for comment owners
- Confirmation dialog with comment preview
- Real-time UI updates after deletion
- Success message showing total items deleted
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### Delete Flow:
1. **User clicks delete button** (🗑️) on their own comment
2. **Confirmation dialog** shows with comment preview
3. **Backend validates** user owns the comment
4. **Cascading deletion**:
   - Finds all replies with `parent_comment_id = commentId`
   - Deletes all replies first
   - Deletes the main comment
5. **Frontend updates** by removing comment and replies from UI
6. **Success feedback** shows total deleted count

### Authorization:
- ✅ Only comment owner can delete their comments
- ✅ User ID validation via headers
- ✅ Ownership verification in database

### API Endpoint:
```
DELETE /api/comments/:commentId
Headers: 
  - user-id: {userId}
  - Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## 🧪 TESTING STEPS

1. **Create a comment** on any post/review
2. **Reply to your comment** (create nested replies)
3. **Click delete button** (🗑️) on your main comment
4. **Confirm deletion** in the dialog
5. **Verify**: Main comment and all replies are deleted
6. **Check database** to confirm cascading deletion worked
