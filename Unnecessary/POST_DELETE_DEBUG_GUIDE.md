## POST DELETE DEBUGGING GUIDE

### 🚨 Current Issue
You're getting a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to delete posts. The frontend is working correctly, but the server is throwing an error.

### 🔧 Immediate Fix Steps

#### Step 1: Restart Your Server
The most likely issue is that your server isn't running with the updated code. 

**Manual Restart:**
1. If your server is running in a terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to stop it
2. In your server directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

#### Step 2: Check Server Startup
When you restart the server, look for any error messages. The server should start without errors and show something like:
```
Server running on port 3000
Database connected successfully
```

#### Step 3: Test the Delete Again
After restarting, try deleting a post from your profile. The server console should now show detailed logs like:
```
=== DELETE POST ENDPOINT HIT ===
Delete post request: { postId: 11, userId: '1', ... }
🔌 Database pool acquired
📝 Checking if post exists...
✅ Post deleted successfully
```

### 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Server Not Restarted**: Most common cause - new logging code isn't active
2. **Database Connection**: Check if your Neon database is accessible
3. **Module Import Error**: Check if all imports in postControllers.js are working
4. **Database Trigger Issue**: The triggers might be causing the 500 error

### 🧪 Quick Test
After restarting, you can also test by opening this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
It should show a response indicating the server is running.

### 📋 What to Check After Restart

1. **Server Console Output**: Look for the detailed logs I added
2. **Browser Console**: Should show the request being sent
3. **Network Tab**: Check the actual HTTP request/response details

If you still get a 500 error after restarting, the detailed server logs will show exactly where the error is occurring.

### 🚀 Expected Working Flow

1. Frontend sends: `DELETE /api/posts/11` with header `user-id: 1`
2. Server logs: All the detailed information I added
3. Database: Trigger executes cascading deletions
4. Response: `{ success: true, message: "Post deleted successfully" }`
5. Frontend: Updates UI to remove the deleted post

**Most likely fix: Just restart your server!** 🔄
