-- SUMMARY
-- =============================================
/*
This script sets up:

1. A trigger function that handles cascading deletions when a post is deleted
2. Foreign key constraints with CASCADE option for proper database-level cascading
3. A cleanup function to remove orphaned data
4. A test function to verify the cascading deletion works properly

Tables affected when a post is deleted:
- post_ratings (deleted automatically via foreign key CASCADE)
- comments (deleted by trigger - entity_type='post')
- votes (deleted by trigger - entity_type='post') 
- notifications (deleted by trigger - entity_type='post')
- photos (deleted by trigger - type='post')
- reports (deleted by trigger - reported_item_type='post')

To test the setup, run:
SELECT test_post_deletion_cascade();

To manually clean up orphaned data, run:
SELECT cleanup_orphaned_post_data();
*/

RAISE NOTICE 'Post deletion triggers and cascading setup completed successfully!';
