# Report System Testing Guide

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Report Buttons Added To:
1. **All Posts** (both rate-my-work and regular posts)
2. **All Reviews** 
3. **All Comments**
4. **PhotoGallery** no longer shows "No photos uploaded yet" when empty

### 🚩 Where to Find Report Buttons:

#### In Feed (/feed):
- **Posts**: Flag icon (🚩) next to voting and comment buttons
- **Reviews**: Flag icon (🚩) next to voting and comment buttons  
- **Comments**: Flag icon (🚩) in each comment's action area

#### In Other Pages:
- **Entity Detail Pages**: Report buttons on reviews and comments
- **Individual Post Pages**: Report buttons on posts and comments

### 🔍 Why Report Button Might Not Show:

1. **User Not Logged In**: Must be authenticated to report
2. **Own Content**: Users cannot report their own posts/comments/reviews
3. **User ID Mismatch**: Ensure proper user authentication

### 🧪 Testing Steps:

#### 1. Set Up Test Environment:
```bash
# Make sure you have at least 2 different users
User A: Alice (your current user)
User B: Create another test user
```

#### 2. Test Report Functionality:
1. **Login as User A**
2. **Create content** (post, review, comment)
3. **Login as User B** 
4. **Navigate to content created by User A**
5. **Look for flag (🚩) icons** next to voting/comment buttons
6. **Click report button** → Report modal should open
7. **Submit report** → Should go to admin queue

#### 3. Test Admin Functionality:
1. **Make User A admin**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE "user" SET isAdmin = true WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
   ```
2. **Login as admin user**
3. **Navigate to /admin/reports**
4. **Review submitted reports**
5. **Take admin actions** (warning, delete, ban, etc.)

### 🎨 Visual Indicators:

#### Report Button Styling:
- **Default**: Gray flag icon
- **Hover**: Red flag with light red background
- **Tooltip**: "Report this post/comment/review"

#### Where They Appear:
```
[👍 Upvote] [👎 Downvote] [💬 Comment] [🚩 Report]
```
