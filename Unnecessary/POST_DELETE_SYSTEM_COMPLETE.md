# Post Deletion System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This system allows users to delete their own posts from their profile page with automatic cascading deletion of all related data.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### Frontend (Profile Component)
- ✅ Delete button added to each post in user's profile
- ✅ Only shows for user's own posts on their own profile
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Automatic UI update after successful deletion
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### Backend (API)
- ✅ DELETE `/api/posts/:postId` endpoint
- ✅ User authorization (only post owner can delete)
- ✅ Post existence validation
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Database Triggers (To Be Set Up)
- 🔧 Cascading deletion triggers for related data
- 🔧 Foreign key constraints with CASCADE options
- 🔧 Cleanup functions for orphaned data

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Test the Frontend
1. Make sure the server is running (`node index.js`)
2. Open the client (`npm run dev` in client folder)
3. Go to your profile page
4. Look for the red trash icon next to your posts
5. Click it and confirm deletion
6. Post should disappear from your profile

### 2. Test the Backend API
You can test the API directly using the test script:

```bash
# In the server directory
node test-delete-api.js
```

Or test manually with curl:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/posts/[POST_ID] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "user-id: [USER_ID]"
```

### 3. Set Up Database Triggers

#### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup script:
```bash
node setup-post-delete-triggers.js
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
1. Open your PostgreSQL database client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
2. Copy and paste the SQL commands from `MANUAL_POST_DELETE_SETUP.sql`
3. Run them one by one

## 🗃️ What Gets Deleted

When a post is deleted, the following related data is automatically removed:

1. **Post Ratings** (`post_ratings` table)
   - All user ratings for the post

2. **Comments** (`comments` table)
   - All comments on the post

3. **Votes** (`votes` table)
   - All upvotes/downvotes on the post

4. **Notifications** (`notifications` table)
   - All notifications related to the post

5. **Photos** (`photos` table)
   - All photos attached to the post

6. **Reports** (`reports` table)
   - All reports made about the post

## 🔒 Security Features

- **User Authorization**: Only the post owner can delete their own post
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm before deletion
- **Validation**: Server validates post existence and ownership
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for various failure scenarios

## 📝 Files Modified/Created

### Frontend Files
- `client/src/components/Profile/Profile.tsx` - Added delete button and handler

### Backend Files
- `server/routes/postRoute.js` - Added DELETE route
- `server/controllers/postControllers.js` - Added deletePost function

### Database Setup Files
- `server/setup-post-delete-triggers.js` - Automated trigger setup
- `MANUAL_POST_DELETE_SETUP.sql` - Manual SQL commands
- `server/test-post-delete.js` - Database test script
- `server/test-delete-api.js` - API test script

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Delete button not showing
- Check if you're on your own profile page
- Verify the post belongs to your user ID

### Issue: "You can only delete your own posts"
- Make sure the `user-id` header matches the post owner
- Check authentication system

### Issue: Related data not deleted
- Run the database trigger setup scripts
- Check if foreign key constraints have CASCADE option

### Issue: API endpoint not found
- Ensure server is running
- Check if the route is properly imported in index.js

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Positive Tests
1. ✅ User can delete their own post
2. ✅ UI updates correctly after deletion
3. ✅ Related data is cascaded (with triggers)
4. ✅ Confirmation dialog appears

### Negative Tests
1. ✅ User cannot delete others' posts
2. ✅ Cannot delete non-existent posts
3. ✅ Proper error messages displayed
4. ✅ UI handles deletion errors gracefully

## 📊 Database Schema Impact

### Tables Affected by Deletion
```sql
post (main table)
├── post_ratings (ratings for rate-my-work posts)
├── comments (comments on the post)
├── votes (upvotes/downvotes)
├── notifications (post-related notifications)
├── photos (attached images)
└── reports (reported content)
```

### Trigger Functions Created
- `handle_post_deletion()` - Main cascading deletion function
- `cleanup_orphaned_post_data()` - Cleanup function for existing orphaned data
- `test_post_deletion_cascade()` - Test function to verify triggers

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up database triggers** using one of the provided methods
2. **Test the complete flow** from frontend to database
3. **Verify cascading deletions** work properly
4. **Consider adding soft deletion** for better data recovery options
5. **Add admin override** for content moderation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

### Dependencies
No additional dependencies required - uses existing project setup.
