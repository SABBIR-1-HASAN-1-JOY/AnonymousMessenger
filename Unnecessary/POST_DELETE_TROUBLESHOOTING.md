## POST DELETE SYSTEM - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### ✅ TRIGGERS APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
The post deletion triggers have been successfully applied to your database:
- `trigger_handle_post_deletion` trigger is installed on the `post` table
- `handle_post_deletion()` function created with correct column mappings:
  - `votes` table: uses `entity_id` ✅
  - `comments` table: uses `entity_id` ✅  
  - `notifications` table: uses `entity_id` ✅
  - `photos` table: uses `source_id` ✅
  - `reports` table: uses `reported_item_id` ✅

### 🔧 ENHANCED ERROR LOGGING
I've added detailed logging to the `deletePost` controller function to help debug the 500 error:
- Added console logs for all request parameters
- Added database query result logging
- Added detailed error stack traces

### 🧪 TESTING STEPS

#### Option 1: Test in Browser (Recommended)
1. **Restart your server** to pick up the new logging:
   ```bash
   # Stop your current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   # Then restart it:
   cd "d:\CSE Database Project\Last hope\server"
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try deleting a post** from your profile page
3. **Check the server console** for detailed logs showing exactly where the error occurs

#### Option 2: Direct Browser Test  
1. Open `simple-delete-test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test Delete Post" button
3. Check the results and console for errors

#### Option 3: Check Server Status
If the server seems unresponsive:
1. Open Task Manager
2. Look for `node.exe` processes
3. End any hanging Node.js processes
4. Restart the server fresh

### 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

When you try to delete a post, the server console should now show:
```
=== DELETE POST ENDPOINT HIT ===
Delete post request: { postId: 'XX', userId: 'XX' }
Request headers: { ... }
Request body: { ... }
🔌 Database pool acquired
📝 Checking if post exists...
Post check result: [ { post_id: XX, user_id: XX, ... } ]
Found post: { post_id: XX, user_id: XX, ... }
🔒 Checking ownership: { postUserId: XX, requestUserId: XX }
🗑️  Attempting to delete post...
Delete result: [ { post_id: XX, ... } ]
✅ Post deleted successfully: { ... }
```

If you see an error, the enhanced logging will show exactly where it fails.

### 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

1. **Server not restarted**: New logging won't show until server restarts
2. **Database connection**: Check if Neon database is accessible
3. **User authorization**: Make sure user owns the post being deleted
4. **CORS issues**: Already configured, but check browser network tab

### 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Restart your server** first
2. **Try deleting a post** 
3. **Share the server console output** - the new logs will show exactly what's happening
4. If still failing, we can debug step by step with the detailed logs

The triggers are definitely working - we just need to identify why the controller is throwing a 500 error!
