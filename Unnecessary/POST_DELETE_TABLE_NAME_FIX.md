# POST DELETE TRIGGERS - TABLE NAME FIX ✅

## 🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

**Problem:** The database triggers were trying to delete from tables with incorrect names:
- ❌ Trying to delete from `"votes"` (plural)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Now deletes from `"vote"` (singular)
- ❌ Trying to delete from `"comments"` (plural)  
- ✅ **Fixed:** Now deletes from `"comment"` (singular)

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

The `handle_post_deletion()` trigger function now uses the correct table names:

```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
DELETE FROM votes WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
DELETE FROM comments WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;

-- AFTER (FIXED):
DELETE FROM vote WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
DELETE FROM comment WHERE entity_type = 'post' AND entity_id = OLD.post_id;
```

## ✅ CORRECTED TRIGGER BEHAVIOR

The trigger now correctly handles cascading deletions from:
- ✅ `vote` table (uses `entity_id`)
- ✅ `comment` table (uses `entity_id`)
- ✅ `notifications` table (uses `entity_id`)
- ✅ `photos` table (uses `source_id`)
- ✅ `reports` table (uses `reported_item_id`)
- ✅ `post_ratings` table (uses `post_id`)

## 🧪 READY TO TEST

**Now you can:**
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click the delete button (🗑️) on any post you own
3. The post should be deleted successfully
4. All related votes, comments, ratings, etc. will be automatically deleted

## 📋 ERROR RESOLVED

**Before:** `error: relation "votes" does not exist`
**After:** ✅ Uses correct table name `"vote"`

The post deletion feature should now work perfectly! 🚀
